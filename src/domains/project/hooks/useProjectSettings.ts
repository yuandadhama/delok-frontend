/**
 * Project settings actions for a single project: rename and delete. Reuses
 * the shared project mutations from `useProjects` so project API logic stays
 * owned by the project domain.
 *
 * The mutations are controlled directly by React Query: `mutateAsync` drives
 * the loading state (`isPending`) and the cache is synchronized in each
 * mutation's `onSuccess`, so the project name is only committed to the UI
 * after the API succeeds.
 *
 * This hook does NOT navigate. Where the user goes after a mutation is a
 * screen-level decision owned by the calling view.
